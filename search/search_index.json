Metabolomics Data There are many datasets from the following publications MPLEx: a Robust and Universal Protocol for Single-Sample Integrative Proteomic, Metabolomic, and Lipidomic Analyses The raw lipidomics data as a start can be found in MassIVE: Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus MHAE003 - MSV000083535 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083534 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083533 These data from Thomas O. Metz's Lab from PNNL are time course studies of the lipidome of the airway epitheleal tissue. Initial Metabolomics Analysis Dataset Feature Detection FBMN MSV000083535 - Positive Data Analysis Analysis MSV000083535 - Negative Data Analysis Analysis Proteomics Data Nuno Bandeira's group is working to analyze public Proteomics data related to SARS-CoV-2. Contributing Data To add your own data, we recommend you upload your datasets to a mass spectrometry repository. The following are great resources: MassIVE - For Proteomics/Metabolomics Data PRIDE - For Proteomics Data Metabolights - For Metabolomics Data We highly encourage you deposit along with it sample metadata, this includes experimental design and sample conditions (e.g. case vs control). Contributing Analyses If you would like to contribute insights on this data or new data that is not included here, please see our GitHub repository and feel free to submit a pull request that we can merge in.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#mass-spectrometry-analysis-of-coronavirus-data","text":"In the current global pandemic, we wanted make available mass spectrometry based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus data.","title":"Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Coronavirus Data"},{"location":"#metabolomics-data","text":"There are many datasets from the following publications MPLEx: a Robust and Universal Protocol for Single-Sample Integrative Proteomic, Metabolomic, and Lipidomic Analyses The raw lipidomics data as a start can be found in MassIVE: Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus MHAE003 - MSV000083535 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083534 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083533 These data from Thomas O.
