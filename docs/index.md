# Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Coronavirus Data

In the current global pandemic, we wanted make available mass spectrometry based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus data. 

You can find analyses and data for [proteomics](proteomics.md) and [metabolomics](metabolomics.md). 

## Contributing Data

To add your own data, we recommend you upload your datasets to a mass spectrometry repository. The following are great resources:

1. [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp) - For Proteomics/Metabolomics Data
1. [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) - For Proteomics Data
1. [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) - For Metabolomics Data

We highly encourage you deposit along with it sample metadata, this includes experimental design and sample conditions (e.g. case vs control). 

## Contributing Analyses

If you would like to contribute insights on this data or new data that is not included here, please see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mwang87/MassSpec-Coronavirus-Project-Docs) and feel free to submit a pull request that we can merge in.
