# Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Coronavirus Data

In the current global pandemic, we wanted make available mass spectrometry based analysis of COVID-19 and related coronavirus data. 

## Metabolomics Data

There are many datasets from the following publications

[MPLEx: a Robust and Universal Protocol for Single-Sample Integrative Proteomic, Metabolomic, and Lipidomic Analyses](https://msystems.asm.org/content/1/3/e00043-16)

The raw lipidomics data as a start can be found in MassIVE:

1. [Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus MHAE003](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e29c0f5896d0409b952ccdd1cc65902d)
